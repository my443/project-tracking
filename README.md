# Project Tracking

This web-app tracks the different projects that a department is working on. Department members have their own login and can only access certain parts of the application. The users stories for this app are as follows. 

## Manager
As a manager I want to know which projects are underway so that I can ensure that strategic goals are met. 

## Department Member
As a contributor I want to have a record of my projects so that I know that I am working on the right things. 

## Senior Leadership
As a senior leader I want to see the metrics of the resources being used (successes of projects, current # of projects) to know that the department is performaning as intended.
